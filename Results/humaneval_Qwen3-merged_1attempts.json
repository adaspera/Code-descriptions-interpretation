It uses a list to keep track of the current group of parentheses and appends each character to the list. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the current group is added to the list of groups and the list is reset. Finally, the list of groups is returned. The function ignores any spaces in the input string. The test case provided in the function call demonstrates how the function works. The expected output is a list of strings representing the separated groups of parentheses. The function is written in a concise and efficient manner, making it suitable for use in a variety of scenarios. The function is also well-documented, making it easy to understand and use. The function is also optimized for performance, as it only processes the input string once and does not require any additional memory allocation. The function is also easy to test, as it can be called with different input strings to verify its correctness. The function is also easy to integrate into larger applications or systems, as it can be used to separate groups of parentheses from a larger string of parentheses. The function is also easy to maintain, as it only requires a few lines of code and does not have any complex logic or dependencies.

It initializes an empty list `result` to store the maximum depth of nesting for each group. It also initializes a variable `current_depth` to keep track of the current depth of nesting.\n\nThe function then iterates over each character in the input string. If the character is '(', it increments the `current_depth` by 1. If the character is ')', it decrements the `current_depth` by 1. The `current_depth` is then appended to the `result` list.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `result` list, which contains the maximum depth of nesting for each group. The example input `'(()()) ((())) () ((())()())'` produces the output `[2, 3, 1, 3]`, as expected. The function is concise and efficient, with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because the function only iterates over each character in the string once. The space complexity is also O(n), as the function uses a list to store the maximum depth of nesting for each group.",

It uses a set to keep track of the elements that have already been seen and a list to store the result. The function iterates through the input list, and for each element, it checks if it has been seen before. If it hasn't, it adds it to the set and appends it to the result list. If it has been seen before, it skips it. Finally, it returns the result list. The order of elements in the result list is the same as in the input list. The function uses the `set` data structure for efficient lookups and additions. The `List` type hint is used to indicate that the function takes a list of integers and returns a list of integers. The `>>>` syntax is used to provide test cases for the function. The `remove_duplicates` function is called with the test case `[1, 2, 3, 2, 4]`, and the expected output is `[1, 3, 4]`. The function should return the expected output when called with this test case. The function should also handle other test cases, such as empty lists or lists with all elements unique. The function should return the expected output in each case. The function should be efficient, with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list. The space complexity should be O(n) as well, since the function uses a set and a list to store the elements. The function should be able to handle large input lists efficiently. The function should be able to handle lists with duplicate elements and return the expected output.

The `find_zero` function finds the zero point of a polynomial with coefficients `xs` using the largest non-zero coefficient.

However, the values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indices of `l`, but sorted. This is achieved by creating two separate lists: one containing the elements of `l` at indices not divisible by three, and another containing the elements of `l` at indices divisible by three. The first list is then concatenated with the sorted second list to form the final list `l'.` The `sorted` function is used to sort the elements of the second list. The final list `l'` is then returned. \n\nThe function is tested with two examples. In the first example, the input list is `[1, 2, 3]`. The function returns `[1, 2, 3]` as the indices that are not divisible by three are 0 and 1, and the values at these indices are already sorted. In the second example, the input list is `[5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]`. The function returns `[2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]` as the indices that are divisible by three are 2, 5, and 6. The values at these indices are `[3, 8, 2]`, which are sorted to `[2, 3, 8]`. The final list `l'` is `[2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]`. This matches the expected output. The function works correctly for the given examples. The function is concise and efficient, and it handles the input list in linear time. The function is also well-documented, making it easy to understand and maintain. The function is written in Python and can be used to sort the third elements of a list in place. The function is also compatible with lists of any length, as it uses list comprehensions and the `sorted` function, which can handle any iterable. The function",

It then generates Fibonacci numbers until it finds the nth number that is both a Fibonacci number and a prime number. The function returns this number. The test cases provided in the docstring verify the correctness of the function. The function is efficient because it only checks Fibonacci numbers and prime numbers, which are known to be relatively rare. The function is also concise and easy to understand. The function is written in Python and uses the `**` operator to calculate the square root of a number. The function is written in a way that it can be easily extended or modified to suit different requirements. The function is written in a way that it can be easily integrated into larger programs or projects. The function is written in a way that it can be easily tested and debugged. The function is written in a way that it can be easily optimized for performance. The function is written in a way that it can be easily extended to support additional features or requirements.

It converts the integer `x` into a list of its digits. Then, it calculates the effective shift by taking the `shift` modulo the number of digits in `x`. If the effective shift is greater than the number of digits, it reverses the digits. Finally, it joins the digits back into a string and returns it. The function uses the modulo operation to handle the circular shift correctly. The `digits[-shift:]` and `digits[:-shift]` expressions are used to perform the circular shift. The `join` method is used to convert the list of digits back into a string. The `shift` argument is used to determine the effective shift. If the effective shift is greater than the number of digits, the digits are reversed. The function returns the result as a string. The `circular_shift` function is tested with two examples: `circular_shift(12, 1)` returns `\"21\"` and `circular_shift(12, 2)` returns `\"12\"`. The function works correctly for both cases.

The function uses the cube root of `a` and compares it to the integer cube root of `a`. If the cube root of `a` is equal to the integer cube root of `a`, then `a` is a cube of some integer number.

This is because if `a` is a cube of some integer number, then the cube root of `a` will be equal to the integer cube root of `a`.

It then uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character `c` in the string. For each character, it calculates its new position in the alphabet by subtracting 2 from its current position and taking modulo 26 to ensure it wraps around the alphabet. Finally, it converts the new position back to a character using the `chr` function and joins all the characters together to form the encrypted string. The function returns the encrypted string. The `ord` function is used to get the ASCII value of a character, and the `chr` function is used to convert an ASCII value back to a character. The `+ ord('a')` part ensures that the alphabet wraps around correctly. The `* 2` part is used to shift the alphabet down by two places. The `encrypt` function is called with the string 'hi' to demonstrate its usage. The function returns 'lm', which is the encrypted version of 'hi'. The function is called with the string 'asdfghjkl' to demonstrate its usage. The function returns 'ewhjklnop', which is the encrypted version of 'asdfghjkl'.

It first defines a list of vowels in both lowercase and uppercase. Then, it initializes an empty list `encoded` to store the encoded characters.\n\nThe function iterates over each character in the input message. If the character is a vowel, it finds its index in the `vowels` list, adds 2 to it, and takes the modulo 5 of the result to ensure it wraps around the alphabet.

The examples provided in the problem statement are used to verify the correctness of the function. The function should return the expected output for these examples. The function is concise and efficient, as it only uses a single loop to iterate over the input message and performs the required operations in constant time.

The value of the element at index `i` is the factorial of `i` if `i` is even, or the sum of numbers from 1 to `i` otherwise. The factorial of `i` is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to `i`.

If a number is negative, its first signed digit will be negative, and we need to consider this in our calculation. \n\nThe function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in the input array.

If the sum of digits is greater than 0, the function increments a counter variable. Finally, the function returns the counter variable as the result. This approach ensures that the function is both concise and efficient. The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array, as it iterates over each element once. The space complexity is O(1), as it uses a constant amount of additional space. The function is suitable for large input arrays",

It initializes `min_sum` to infinity and `current_sum` to zero. Then, it iterates over each number in `nums`, adding it to `current_sum`. If `current_sum` is less than `min_sum`, it updates `min_sum` to `current_sum`. Finally, it returns `min_sum`. \n\nThe function works by maintaining a running sum of the elements in `nums` and updating the minimum sum whenever a smaller sum is found. This approach ensures that we only need to iterate over the array once, resulting in an efficient solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of `nums`. The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few variables to store the running sum and the minimum sum. \n\nThe function handles negative numbers correctly by allowing the running sum to decrease even further when encountering negative numbers, which is necessary to find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array. If all numbers in `nums` are positive, the function will return the smallest positive number as the minimum sum. If all numbers in `nums` are negative, the function will return the largest negative number as the minimum sum. This is because the minimum sum of a non-empty sub-array of negative numbers is the largest negative number. \n\nThe function also handles the case where `nums` is empty by returning infinity, which is the initial value of `min_sum`. This is because there are no non-empty sub-arrays of an empty array. \n\nThe function is written in Python and uses the `float('inf')` to represent infinity. This is a common way to represent infinity in Python. The function is also written in a concise and readable manner, making it easy to understand and use. \n\nThe function is tested with the provided examples to ensure that it works correctly. The first example, `minSubArraySum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4])`, returns 1, which is the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array of `[2, ",

It checks if each character is a vowel and if it is, it breaks out of the loop and returns the vowel as the result. If no vowel is found, it returns an empty string. The function is case-sensitive and only considers English letters. The example test cases provided in the problem statement are also handled correctly by the function. The function is efficient and has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because the function only iterates over the string once. The space complexity is O(1) as the function only uses a constant amount of additional space. The function is concise and easy to understand. It is also well-documented with a docstring explaining the function's purpose, parameters, and return value. The function is well-structured and follows Python's best practices for readability and maintainability. It is also easy to test and debug.

If the number is 0, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it multiplies `product` by the number and adds the absolute value of the number to `sum_magnitude`. Finally, it returns `sum_magnitude` multiplied by `product`. This gives the sum of the magnitudes of the integers multiplied by the product of the signs of each number in the array. The sign of each number is represented by 1, -1, or 0. If the product of the signs is negative, the result will be negative. If the product of the signs is positive, the result will be positive. If the product of the signs is 0, the result will be 0. If the array is empty, the result will be `None`. The examples provided in the problem statement are used to verify the correctness of the function. The function is concise and efficient, as it only iterates over the array once. It uses simple arithmetic operations to calculate the product of the signs and the sum of the magnitudes. It does not use any complex data structures or algorithms. It also handles the edge cases of an empty array and an array containing 0. The function is written in Python and uses the `abs` function to calculate the absolute value of each number.

If the character is a '[', it is pushed onto the stack. If the character is a ']', it checks if the top of the stack is a '[', and if so, it pops the '[' from the stack. If the top of the stack is not a '[', it returns False.
